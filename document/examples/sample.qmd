  This document demonstrates the features of the Quarto to LaTeX/PDF pipeline.
  It includes styled theorem environments, raw LaTeX passthrough, code execution
  for both Python and R, and custom typography.

# Introduction

This is a sample Quarto document that serves as a test case for our custom PDF output pipeline. It showcases various features required for academic and technical writing.

## Typography and Layout

The document uses `Libertinus Serif` for the main text, with `Libertinus Math` for equations. The page geometry is set to have 1-inch margins, and the line spacing is slightly increased for readability.

# Theorem Environments

Our custom `header.tex` defines several theorem-like environments. They are numbered within sections.

\begin{theorem}[A Sample Theorem]
Let $f$ be a continuous function on a closed interval $[a, b]$. If $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, then there exists at least one point $c \in (a, b)$ such that $f(c) = 0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
This is the Intermediate Value Theorem. The proof is omitted here but would typically follow a statement like this.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Continuity]
A function $g: D \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at a point $x_0 \in D$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x \in D$ with $|x - x_0| < \delta$, we have $|g(x) - g(x_0)| < \epsilon$.
\end{definition}

# Raw LaTeX Passthrough

Use Pandoc's native `{=latex}` syntax for raw LaTeX. This is supported out of the box by Quarto/Pandoc.

```{=latex}
\begin{center}
  \textit{This text is centered using raw \LaTeX\ commands.}
\end{center}
```

# Code Execution

The pipeline supports executing code in multiple languages.

## Python Chunk

This chunk uses Python to generate a plot with `matplotlib` and a table with `pandas`.

```{python}
#| label: fig-python
#| fig-cap: "A simple plot generated with Python."

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate some data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x) * np.exp(-x / 5)

# Create a plot
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
plt.plot(x, y, label='sin(x) * exp(-x/5)')
plt.title("Python-Generated Plot")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Create a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'],
    'Value': [10, 20, 15, 25],
    'Ratio': [0.15, 0.25, 0.20, 0.40]
})

# Print the DataFrame as a Markdown table
print(df.to_markdown(index=False))
```

## R Chunk

This chunk uses R to create a summary table from the `mtcars` dataset using `knitr::kable`.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-r
#| tbl-cap: "A summary of the mtcars dataset from R."

library(knitr)
data(mtcars)

summary_df <- head(mtcars[, 1:4])

kable(summary_df, format = "pipe", caption = "First 4 columns of mtcars.")
```

# Conclusion

This document successfully demonstrates all the core requirements of the specification, including custom styling, theorem environments, native raw LaTeX passthrough, and multi-language code execution.
